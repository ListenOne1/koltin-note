# Overview

This is a command-line listing program in the Koltin language. The program is to help users organize shopping lists or To-Do lists. The purpose of writing this software is because I want to have better time management skills. "Cap Your To-Do List at Three Things Every Day" is a concept I read on the internet. I am trying to simplify the process by writing this program.

 Inside the program, there are four different main functions, display, add, delete and switch. In the display function, it will display the list user currently have. In add and delete function simply add and delete the note you want. The switch function is to switch two different lists to let user easily organize their list. The vision for this Project is to make a mobile listing APP.
